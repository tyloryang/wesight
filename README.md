WeSight is an open-source desktop app that turns coding agents and automation runtimes into a friendly graphical workspace. It helps you start tasks, switch agent engines, configure model providers, review tool execution, manage skills, and keep long-running work organized from one place.

The goal is simple: install WeSight, choose an engine, configure your model once, then work with powerful agents through a polished chat interface.

## Highlights

- **Multiple agent engines** - Use Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, or the built-in Claude Agent SDK runner from the same chat workspace.
- **One-click engine setup** - WeSight can install and prepare supported local CLIs/runtimes for you. Claude Code and Codex CLI setup prefers npm on macOS; OpenClaw and Hermes Agent use WeSight-managed runtime builders.
- **Use existing local CLI accounts** - If Claude Code or Codex is already installed and logged in, WeSight can reuse the local CLI configuration instead of forcing a new model setup.
- **Unified model settings** - Configure OpenAI-compatible providers, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Qwen, Gemini, Moonshot, Ollama, OpenRouter, GitHub Copilot, and custom providers from one settings page.
- **Graphical chat for CLI agents** - Claude Code and Codex feel like desktop chat apps: stream output, inspect tool calls, review command results, and continue the same session visually.
- **Engine switching in context** - Pick an engine when creating a task, then switch from the chat header when the task needs a different runtime.
- **Permission-aware execution** - File access, shell commands, and sensitive operations surface as reviewable events so you stay in control.
- **Slash command panels** - Type `/` in chat to open command suggestions and agent context panels for model, status, help, config, skills, memory, and more.
- **Skills and workflows** - Built-in skills cover web search, Office documents, spreadsheets, presentations, PDF work, Playwright automation, video generation, email, stock research, and more.
- **Scheduled tasks** - Create recurring agent jobs for research, reports, inbox cleanup, reminders, or automation workflows.
- **Memory and personalization** - WeSight can extract useful preferences from conversations and reuse them across future sessions.
- **Desktop companion** - Optional desktop pet in Appearance settings, with animated sprites and lightweight interaction.

## Agent Engines

| Engine | Best For | Setup Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Built-in Claude Agent SDK | General local cowork sessions and skill execution | Included in WeSight |
| Claude Code | Claude Code workflows in a graphical chat surface | macOS one-click CLI install or existing local CLI config |
| Codex | Codex CLI workflows in a graphical chat surface | macOS one-click CLI install or existing local CLI config |
| OpenClaw | Sandbox-style agent runtime and gateway integrations | WeSight-managed pinned runtime |
| Hermes Agent | Local Hermes Agent runtime experiments | WeSight-managed pinned runtime |

## Model Configuration

WeSight has a unified model settings layer for user-facing configuration.

- Add multiple providers and models.
- Enable or disable providers without editing terminal config files.
- Map WeSight model settings into Claude Code or Codex when using WeSight-managed configuration.
- Use local CLI configuration for Claude Code or Codex when you want to keep the account/provider setup already present on your machine.
- Configure custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints for local, private, or third-party model services.

This lets beginners avoid CLI configuration while still giving advanced users control over their local agent environment.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Node.js `>=24 <25`
- npm

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/freestylefly/wesight.git
cd wesight
npm install
npm run electron:dev
```

The Vite dev server runs at `http://localhost:5175`.

### Development With Managed Runtimes

```bash
# Build or reuse the pinned OpenClaw runtime, then start WeSight
npm run electron:dev:openclaw

# Build or reuse the pinned Hermes Agent runtime, then start WeSight
npm run electron:dev:hermes
```

Useful runtime environment variables:

```bash
# Override OpenClaw source location
OPENCLAW_SRC=/path/to/openclaw npm run electron:dev:openclaw

# Force OpenClaw runtime rebuild
OPENCLAW_FORCE_BUILD=1 npm run electron:dev:openclaw

# Skip OpenClaw version checkout for local OpenClaw development
OPENCLAW_SKIP_ENSURE=1 npm run electron:dev:openclaw
```

## Build

```bash
# TypeScript + Vite + Electron bundle
npm run build

# ESLint
npm run lint
```

## Packaging

```bash
# macOS
npm run dist:mac
npm run dist:mac:x64
npm run dist:mac:arm64
npm run dist:mac:universal

# Windows
npm run dist:win

# Linux
npm run dist:linux
```

Runtime builders are pinned in `package.json`:

- `openclaw.version`
- `hermes.version`

Windows packages can bundle a portable Python runtime for Python-based skills. OpenClaw and Hermes runtime folders are generated under `vendor/` and ignored by Git.

## Architecture

WeSight uses Electron process isolation. The renderer never directly accesses Node.js APIs; all privileged operations go through a typed preload bridge and IPC handlers in the main process.

### Main Process

- Window lifecycle and tray behavior
- SQLite persistence
- Agent engine routing
- Claude Code and Codex external CLI adapters
- OpenClaw and Hermes runtime managers
- Skill loading and service management
- Scheduled task engine
- IM gateway and notification integrations

### Renderer

- React + Redux Toolkit + Tailwind CSS
- Cowork chat UI
- Engine selector and model selector
- Settings, skills, scheduled tasks, agents, MCP, and appearance UI
- Stream rendering for messages, tool calls, command output, and slash command panels

```

## Built-in Skills

WeSight includes a broad skills library for day-to-day agent work:

| Area | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Research | web search, tech news, stock research, film/music search |
| Documents | DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, PDF processing |
| Automation | Playwright, local tools, scheduled tasks |
| Creative | Remotion video, frontend design, canvas design, Seedream, Seedance |
| Communication | IMAP/SMTP email |
| Agent building | skill creator, skill vetting, custom planning |

Skills can be enabled, disabled, and routed from the desktop UI.

## Security Model

- Context isolation is enabled.
- Node integration is disabled in the renderer.
- Sensitive actions are routed through main-process IPC.
- Tool execution can surface permission requests before running.
- Local data is stored in SQLite under the app data directory.
- Generated runtime folders, build artifacts, and local secrets are ignored by Git.

## Roadmap Ideas

- More engine adapters and runtime profiles
- Better model migration and provider import flows
- Shareable task templates
- Richer slash command results
- More visual inspection tools for long-running agent tasks
- Plugin marketplace for community skills
